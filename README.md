For SQL beginners, there is no doubt that sqlzoo is a perfect website to learn and practice SQL.

There are two main reasons:
 1. There are a lot of practice questions for every single syntex of SQL so that beginners can master every syntex quickly.

 2. This website is being written in English, Japanese and Chinese. So no matter which country you come from, there will be no problem to understand it.


I am also a SQL beginner.
I summarized my own answers of those practice questions that I solved and update them to Github.
My answers might not the best,
but I still hope they can help you in some way.

I put answers from different chapters to different documents.
You can find them by the title of the documents.
In documents, I record every question’s index and Japanese text so that it’s very easy to find the answer you are looking for.

Feel free to give me any advice.
